1. *Audience*: The genre of mobile game ads has a wide range of audience, but the viewers usually consume the content passively. Examining the ads' content suggests the intended target audience is 'casual gamers.' Though this designation does not particularly narrow down the demographic, which works in the ads' favour, it does highlight certain commonalities amongst this cohort. The typical audience member in this category engages with gaming to kill time and often belongs to an older age bracket, with statistics indicating that over a quarter of this group are 40 and above. Unlike their younger counterparts (the stereotypical dedicated, young, hobbyist gamer), they generally have limited time for gaming.
1. *Purpose*: The primary aim of this genre is to entice viewers into downloading the advertised game, leading to further engagement through in-game advertisements or purchases. The deliberate inclusion of absurd or quirky content also sparks discussions and gains organic exposure, broadening the advertisement's reach.
2. *Context*: These ads, exemplified by a single-click feature leading directly to app store downloads, mirror the advancement of the advertising industry in the digital era. Advertisers aimed to streamline the user journey from ad viewing to game downloading. Consequently, a trend of harnessing strong emotional appeals emerged to captivate audiences in a digitally saturated market. The rush to seize attention spurred the cloning of successful ads, thereby diluting authenticity and creativity.
3. *Genre*: This genre lacks a rigid definition; hence, I employ the following `conventions' to delineate this subgenre of gaming ads, also serving as guidelines for selecting examples.
   * Representation of gameplay: These ads typically depict a character engaging with a game, commonly represented by a cartoonish moving finger. However, the gameplay footage showcased often bears little resemblance to the game being advertised.
   * Narrative elements: The narrative within these ads usually centres around a heroically dressed protagonist or a scenario where the player aids someone in a perilous or distressing situation, evoking a sense of empathy from the viewers.
