1. *Flaunt*:
   * My ability to research, synthesise articles, reason, and write effectively about various topics
   * Sometimes, translating my thoughts from Mandarin to English can produce interesting effects through defamiliarisation
2. *Leave out*:
   * I struggle with expressing emotional or personal content in English
   * My English prose often tends to be too bland
3. *Doubts*:
   * I often become immersed in my thoughts and can’t estimate how engaging my writings are
   * Therefore, I sometimes over-explain or do not elaborate enough (I don’t want to be received as mansplaining!)
