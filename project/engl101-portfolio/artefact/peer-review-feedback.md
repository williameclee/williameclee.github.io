Overall I think this is a great paper, you outlined everything [Ms. Walsh] wanted and did it in a sophisticated way to where she can just scroll and find it she doesn’t really have to look for it.
Your criticisms are good.

The only thing I would work on is stating a thesis, I read it and couldn’t really pick it out.

- Maybe shorten a bit


> I really appreciate the peer review feedback I got for my genre analysis paper.
> It was super helpful and made me see things from a different perspective after working alone on it for too long.
> So, here’s what I did based on the feedback:
>
> 1. I decided to keep section titles in my paper. I initially added them just to keep myself on track, but it turned out they helped the reader too.
> 1. I was trying an unconventional introduction to the paper by sharing a first-person encounter and didn’t mention my thesis until way later. I took in the feedback and revised the paragraphs to state the thesis more explicitly and concisely from the start.
> 1. I was reminded that I got side-tracked while analysing the genre and discussed elements that didn’t  connect to my main point. So, I trimmed down those parts and kept the focus on what really mattered for my thesis.
