* *PART 1 Before listening to the music*: No particular feeling... besides tiredness. I don't have too many classes today so I'm not stressed, but I am not really looking forward to these classes either.
* *PART 3 After listening to the music*: Feel sorry for the cellist (the part I used to play in the recorder band), and slightly annoyed by how overused this piece is.
Reminds me of the cleaning time in elementary school, when the shool would broadcast this piece (do Taiwanese have a fetish of associating cleaning/rubbish with classical music?).
No significant mood change (still tired).
