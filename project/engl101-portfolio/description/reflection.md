# Reflection

Reflecting is tricky; analysing my strengths and weaknesses is doubtlessly crucial for growth, yet very uncomfortable.
I feel narcissistic while also doubting my abilities.

Sometimes, it gets under my skin to the point of paranoia. 
Nights after submitting projects, I toss and turn, thinking how I could’ve done better. 
Even when positive feedback comes in, I’m left with a nagging sense of disappointment. 
How do I deserve those good grades when there’s still so much room for improvement?

Writing in my second language, English, is where I know there’s much room for growth, and those thoughts are constantly swirling in my mind.
But there’s also the lurking fear that overthinking might make me overly self-conscious, preventing me from taking risks to actually become better at it. . .
