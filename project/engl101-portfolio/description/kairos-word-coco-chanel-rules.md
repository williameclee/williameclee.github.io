# Kairos word on Coco Chanel's rules of style

After completing the literacy narrative, I reflected on my writing strengths according to Coco Chanel's three rules of style.

At that time, I decided I was relatively better at academic writing in English, as how beautiful my writing is not as important as how clear and concise it is, and I could focus more on the content of my writing.
However, this style was something I wanted to 'leave out', or improve on.
I wanted to be able to write in a more expressive and creative way for purposes other than assignments, and I wanted to be able to communicate more sophisicated ideas and feelings.
