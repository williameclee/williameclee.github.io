# Kairos word on Coco Chanel’s rules of style

Shortly after completing the literacy narrative, I reflected on my writing strengths according to Coco Chanel’s three rules of style.

At that time, I decided I was better at academic writing in English, where the focus shifted from the beauty of prose to clarity and conciseness. I could redirect my efforts towards the substantive aspect of my writing.
However, the territory of deeper emotions, those aspects I ‘left out’ due to my incompetency, was precisely what I wanted to (and still want to) improve and become good at expressing.
I am working towards being able to write more expressively and creatively for purposes other than some maths assignments, and I want to communicate more sophisticated ideas and feelings.
