# Peer Review Feedback on the Genre Analysis

Later down in the semester, while I was writing the genre analysis, I became more experienced with writing in English, and I was really invested in what I was writing.
As a byproduct, I sneaked in too many details of the genre I found interesting, and the draft became too long and unfocused unawaring, similar to some's criticism towards Wikipedia articles.

The peer review feedback drew me out of my own perspective, and helped me to identify the problems with my draft.
I cut down a significant portion of the text, and focused on the rhetorical elements that were most relevant to the genre.
