# Peer Review Feedback on the Genre Analysis

When I started to work on my genre analysis project later in the semester, I was much more experienced writing in English and became more invested.
However, this newfound enthusiasm had a side effect--my early drafts drowned in a swamp of details about the genre that I found intriguing but nonessential to the thesis. 
They were like those lengthy Wikipedia articles, and I didn’t want my paper to be anywhere close to that!

Then came the peer review feedback. 
It pressed me to step back and see the issues with my draft. 
So, I started trimming the excess and honed in on the essential rhetorical elements that mattered for my genre analysis. 
It’s like I finally found the right path through the writing swamp, thanks to that piece of feedback.
