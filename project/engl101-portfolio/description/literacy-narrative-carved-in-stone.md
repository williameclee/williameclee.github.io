# Project 1 - Literacy narrative: Carved in Stone

In terms of genre, the literacy narrative was supposed the most familiar to me, since I've written a lot of prose in the past.
However, this was definately the first time I've written a prose at such length in English, and I had to pay extra attention to the conventions of the language.
Therefore, after I finished the first draft, I spent a week revising it; while I was able to identify most of the grammatical errors (with the help of Grammarly), I didn't have a good sense of my writing style, and I had to rely heavily on the feedback from Ms. Walsh.
This was one of the most frustrating experience I had in this class, as I was unsatified with my writing, but my revisions didn't seem to improve the quality of my writing.
