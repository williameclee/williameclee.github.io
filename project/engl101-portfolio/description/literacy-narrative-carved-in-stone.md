# Project 1 - Literacy narrative: Carved in Stone

Among all the literary genres, the first project in our course--a literacy narrative--should have been the most familiar to me. 
As Taiwanese students, we spent too much time writing prose in school, and I thought I was good at it.

However, writing extended English prose proved to be a profound challenge.
Expressing intimate thoughts and life experiences in a second language was HARD.
I frequently found myself crafting vivid sentences in Mandarin, only to witness their vibrancy wither as I desperately tried to recapture them in English.

After completing my rough draft, I dedicated a week to mindlessly revising. 
While most grammatical errors could be corrected (mainly with the help of *Grammarly*), my attempts at translating my writing style into English brought endless frustration. 
It was depressing. 
I was dissatisfied with the quality of my writing, but the revisions could not elevate it.
