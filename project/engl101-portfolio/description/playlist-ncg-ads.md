# A YouTube playlist of non-core gameplay ads

For the genre analysis, I spent way too much time on YouTube, watching mobile game ads and trying to find the commonalities between them.
I created a playlist of the ads I found, and annotated them with my thoughts and observations.
Then I used the playlist as a reference for my genre analysis, analysing how they used similar rhetorical elements to achieve their goals, and what are the effects of each element.
