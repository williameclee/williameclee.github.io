# A YouTube playlist of non-core gameplay ads

When composing the genre analysis, I dived deep into the dirty corners of YouTube, absorbing tens of obnoxious mobile game ads to uncover the traits that make them so recognisable.
I compiled a YouTube playlist, loading it with the perfectly terrible ads I stumbled upon. 
This playlist later guided me through the research process of genre analysis. 
I dissected these ads, examining their shared rhetorical tools and researching the effect of each element.
