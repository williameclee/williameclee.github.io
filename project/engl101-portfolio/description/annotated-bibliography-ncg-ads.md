# Project 2 - Annotated bibliography: None-core gameplay ads

After identifying the rhetorical elements, I started to research the genre and the rhetorical elements I identified by compiling an annotated bibliography.
Although I found a lot of sources related to this topic, a lot of them are biased either towards the game developers or the players, and I had to be careful to extract factual information from them.

This was also when I finally started to pay closer attention to the rules of different citation styles, since I couldn't let $\LaTeX$ do all the work for me this time.
