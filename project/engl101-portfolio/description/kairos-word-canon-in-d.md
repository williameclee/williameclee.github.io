# Kairos word on Canon in D

This is a Kairos word activity we did in the first half of the semester, and was one of my first tastes of anlysing rhetorical situations in this class.
We listened to the infamous Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel, and were
asked to write down our moods before and after.
I noticed I was annoyed by this piece beacuse of my previous engagement with this piece as a performer, and the context of where the piece was often played.
