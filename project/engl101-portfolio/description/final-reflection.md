# Final reflection

Have I dug too deep into the abyss of self-doubt and despair? ‘Reflection’ is such a weighty word, and its effects on my mood are profound.

In hindsight, I can acknowledge the distance I’ve covered, yet the path to becoming a proficient writer stretches endlessly before me. Throughout the semester, I dedicated considerable effort just to infuse my texts with a sense of ‘me’ and not sound like the robotic over-polishing of Grammarly or the generic monstrosity spitted out by ChatGPT.

I’m still in the process of discovering the ethos in which I am most comfortable writing. 
However, progress has been made, particularly when I involuntarily reflect on the laughably bad and bland essays I submitted as part of my application to this school just half a year ago. Besides class notes and lab reports, those were the longest pieces I had ever written in English.

Yet, the most valuable lesson from this class goes beyond writing itself; it’s about crafting a healthier writing workflow and how important it is to have other’s feedback. 
Revision, which used to be my Achilles’ heel, no longer haunts me as dauntingly as it once did. 
I vividly remember the darkest hours composing the project for my Chinese creative writing class last winter.
I locked myself in my dorm room for a week, endlessly revising the same 3000-word draft, feeling trapped in an unending loop.

With the aid of ever-evolving technology, the skills I have now may be sufficient for most writing tasks I’ll encounter in the foreseeable future—reports, summaries, and even a thesis. But I aim higher than merely ‘being able to do it.’ My selfish part wants to feel like I am writing something meaningful.

To this goal, there are only so many obstacles towards writing well that writing can solve.
I need to broaden my horizons and read extensively beyond textbooks and journal articles, some of which may be even more poorly worded than this ongoing rant. 
My understanding of ‘good writing’ in English remains constrained, and relying solely on instincts honed in Chinese writing is impossible. 
The path ahead is still long, but the journey is one I’m determined to undertake.
