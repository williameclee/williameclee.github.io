# Revision

Revision has always been a crucial step of my writing journey. 
My creative impulses come in bursts, often unfolding in out-of-order short sequences. 
Thus, lots of my efforts are devoted solely to revisiting and refining my prior compositions, ensuring they align with the overarching narrative.

Throughout this class, I improved my writing skills and reexamined my workflow. 
Central to this growth is utilising the invaluable outsider feedback I’ve received from both my peers and the eye of Ms. Walsh. 
Identifying and addressing issues within my writing through someone else’s perspective has made me much more proficient.
