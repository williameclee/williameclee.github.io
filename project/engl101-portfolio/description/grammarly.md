# A Grammarly Identity Crisis

During this semester’s intensive writing in English, I have been facing an identity crisis: am I in my own voice or copying the style of the authors and textbooks I read?

Initially, my objective was simple: avoid basic grammar mistakes. 
Grammarly has been a trusty companion, and I have become reliant on it.

Yet, as helpful as it can be, Grammarly isn’t flawless. 
Its suggestions often feel out of place, making my text overly clinical and stripped of personality. 
Despite my reservations, I often comply with its advice; my confidence in my own writing and grammatical knowledge is somewhat shaky.

Then there’s the temptation of Grammarly’s ‘synonyms’ feature. 
It’s a seducing proposition, promising to elevate my casual, conversational tone and broaden my limited vocabulary. 
But while composing the genre analysis, I noticed a troubling trend: I was swapping words for fancier alternatives, some of which I didn’t fully grasp. 

What am I writing?
