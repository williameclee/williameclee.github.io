# A Grammarly Identity Crisis

I have been facing an identity crisis as I am writing in English, as I am not sure if I am writing in my own voice, or if I am just imitating the style of the authors I read.
My first goal has been to write in a way that is grammatically correct, and I have been using Grammarly to help me with that.

However, Grammarly is not perfect, and sometimes its suggestions are not applicable to the context and sometimes make my text incredibly blend and devoid of personality.
But I still find myself following its suggestions, as I am not confident enough in my own writing.

Consequently, the 'synonym' feature of Grammarly is too tempting sometimes, it seems like an easy way to elevate my conversational-tone writing and expand my limited vocabulary.
I started questioning what I was doing when writing the genre analysis when I found myself replacing words with big words that I didn't fully understand.
