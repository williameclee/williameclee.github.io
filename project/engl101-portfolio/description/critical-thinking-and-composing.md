# Critical Thinking and Composing & Conventions

Critical thinking, unfortunately, wasnâ€™t exactly the focus during my earlier education in Taiwan. 
Most of my earlier training revolved around creative writing (e.g. prose) and summarising (e.g. literature review), leaving little time for polishing this crucial skill.

But here in this class, I took a leap. I honed my critical thinking skills by dissecting those laughably bad mobile game ads. 
With a critical eye, I unravelled the web of rhetorical elements they used to achieve their objectives.
