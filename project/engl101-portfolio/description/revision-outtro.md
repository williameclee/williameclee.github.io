# Revision - final thoughts

Revising is always the most dreadful part, as I am almost never satisfied with my writing, and get stuck in details.
My worst experience was when I was working on my nature writing project for my Chinese creative writing class last winter, when I locked myself alone in my dorm room for a week, and revised the same 3000-word draft over and over again, and felt I was getting nowhere.
It was definitely unhealthy in retrospect, as I didn't get any third party feedback, and I was too focused on the details to see the big picture.
