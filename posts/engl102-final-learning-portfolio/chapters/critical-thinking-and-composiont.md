For Project 2, I carried the rhetorical awareness I obtained when working on Project 1. I had to adapt my writing style to suit different contexts, audiences, and purposes. 
I expanded on the topic I researched for the previous project and wrote a blog post about it. 
However, Its audience was the general public, which required me to adopt a more engaging and accessible tone to resonate with a broader online readership. 
I imagined my blog post would belong to an online magazine focusing on food culture outreach. 
It suited my lighthearted topic while allowing me to showcase my research skills and explore complex arguments. 
Therefore, I had to adjust my writing to make it more engaging and accessible to the general public. 

Besides the medium I chose for the project, it also impacted how I made arguments and the tone of my writing. 
For example, I related every theoretical framework regarding cultural hybridity to Taiwan and the pizza mashups I discussed, slowly familiarising the reader with the context before diving into the analysis. 
While I did not use ‘I’ in my writing, I introduced more quotes and images in a way that felt like telling a story instead of following the strict structure of an academic paper. 
I was happy with the final result, and I think I found a good balance—medium, tone, and content—to make my writing engaging and informative for the intended audience.
