Applying appropriate conventions is crucial in academic writing to communicate scientific ideas efficiently. 
For one of my other classes, I wrote a draft of a research paper for my summer research project, including an introduction and a literature review. 
In this assignment, I tried to follow the structure of the articles in my relevant field—Earth and planetary sciences—that I read during the literature review. 
The conventions I concluded from the articles heavily influenced the structure of my paper. 
For example, I noticed that the introduction and literature review are usually combined into one section, are concise, and heavily assume prior knowledge from the reader. 
Therefore, I followed the essence of these conventions in my paper, but I also took the audience of this specific draft into account. 
Thus, the resulting draft contained an introductory paragraph for general readers and auxiliary subsection headings to guide the reader through the literature review. 

Other minor but essential conventions I followed include how prior research is introduced, what citation style is used, the appropriate use of acronyms and punctuations, and the tone of the writing. 
I still struggled to condense the information in the literature review. 
It was tempting to include many details to demonstrate my understanding of the topic and my effort in reading the articles. 
I had to remind myself that the purpose of the literature review is to provide a concise summary of the prior research to support my specific research niche and research question. 
Nonetheless, this draft will not be the final version of the paper, and I will continue to revise it and consult with my research advisor to improve it.
