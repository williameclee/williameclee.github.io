I have been reflecting on my projects and feedback to track my growth and refine my skills. 
I have attached my reflection on Project 1, my first writing-intensive assignment this semester. 
Although I had been doing similar writing assignments in other classes, they were broken down into smaller parts. 
In the reflection, I discussed how I used these smaller assignments to prepare for Project 1, my approach to the writing process, and what I learned from the feedback I received. 
I also focused on ‘forward reflection,’ contemplating applying what I learned from Project 1 to future writing assignments and what I still needed to work on. 
I remember these reflections when working on new projects and class assignments. 
Although the concerns I had in the reflection were not fully resolved, I have made progress in addressing them. 
I have continuously evaluated whether my writing is accessible, uses appropriate terminology, and examines the scientific values and weaknesses of the articles I have read. 
As my other professor pointed out, the ability to synthesise complex ideas will help us avoid being replaced by AI in the future.
