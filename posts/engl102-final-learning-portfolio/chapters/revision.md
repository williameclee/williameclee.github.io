Feedback from readers has allowed me to identify and bridge cultural gaps, adjust the tone, and ultimately enhance engagement with my audience. 
I sometimes lose track of the main goal of the writing or whom I am writing for. 
Having someone else read my writing and provide feedback is always helpful. 
For Project 1, I wrote about the pizza mashups Pizza Hut had offered in Taiwan. 
It was a fun topic rooted in the culture I grew up in, but the cultural context and references were not necessarily familiar to my intended audience. 
Therefore, I greatly appreciated my peer reviewers, who informed me about which parts of my writing helped them understand the topic and which parts were confusing. 
I also adjusted my tone based on feedback from my instructor, Dr. Caves. 
I revised my draft to make my writing more straightforward and less clinical than I would have written in a scientific paper. 
These choices were made to make the writing more engaging and accessible to my audience, and I have carried these changes over to Project 2.
