This semester’s work in the ENGL102 course has been valuable in developing my writing skills and evaluating the value of prior literature as an ESL speaker. 
Throughout this course, I am proud of what I have learned: how to better identify and adapt to different conventions or audiences and effectively communicate complex ideas—a critical skill set for my future career in science.
While I gained confidence in adapting my writing style from academic to more public-focused mediums, there remains room for improvement, particularly in balancing detail with conciseness and enhancing reader engagement without sacrificing content depth. 
Feedback from peers and instructors has been instrumental in this learning process, helping me see what I can improve on.

These skills are not just academic necessities but essential tools for my aspiration to become an effective science communicator. 
The ability to synthesise complex scientific ideas into accessible information is crucial. 
My journey through these projects has equipped me with these capabilities and set a mindset towards continuous improvement and adaptation.
The experiences and skills from this course have prepared me to face the challenges of scientific communication with confidence and adaptability. 
As I move forward, I will carry these lessons into my scientific career, continually striving to refine my ability to convey critical concepts in informative and engaging ways to a broad audience.
