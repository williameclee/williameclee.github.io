This portfolio collects the best of my work and efforts in this semester’s ENGL102: First-Year Composition course. 
The artefacts showcase my growth in academic writing and the research skills that support it. 
During this course, I learned a crucial lesson in identifying appropriate conventions for different topics and genres and adapting my writing to suit diverse audiences and purposes. 
I didn’t limit myself to traditional academic essays; I explored other mediums and practised how to make my writing more engaging and accessible to the general public. 
These skills and mindset are valuable and are not limited to this course’s projects and essays. 
As someone who aspires to become a proficient science communicator but speaks English as a second language, I have consciously applied them to other writing assignments from different classes. 
The following artefacts demonstrate my growth as a writer and application of these skills.
