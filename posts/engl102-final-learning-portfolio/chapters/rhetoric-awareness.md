An author’s style, tone, and structure choices in a text are influenced by the intended audience, purpose, and context. 
Rhetoric awareness helps writers connect with their target audience effectively; analysing these factors also empowers me to make deliberate decisions when composing. 
In Project 1, I used the annotation detail chart to help me realise why some articles felt more effective and credible. 
The most persuasive arguments utilised the authors’ position and relation to the primary audience. 
It influenced how I approached my following Project 2, from the medium I chose to how I made statements.

Understanding what value or knowledge the authors assumed about their audience was challenging. 
I quickly noticed biases when I disagreed with the author. However, evaluating the author’s assumptions was more complicated when we shared similar views. 
I had to exercise self- and cultural awareness and pay close attention to the logic and evidence the author used to support their arguments. 
This exercise helped me become more aware of my preconceptions.
