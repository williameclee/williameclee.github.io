					After an exhaustive day at school, I turned to YouTube for relaxation while
					my dinner rotated in the microwave. My calm was, however, soon shattered by
					a loud mobile game advertisement (see Fig. 1). A scene unfolded with a man
					in distress frantically fleeing from flames. An animated finger manipulated
					colossal sewing pins to remove obstacles along his escape. In a critical
					moment, the finger’s aid failed, leading to the man’s demise in the flames.
				</p>
				<p>
					The drama concluded by displaying the game’s title, <i>Homescapes</i>,
					alongside
					an ‘Install Now’ button (Playrix, 2017). While intuitively suspicious about
					the commercial’s authenticity—a result of encounters with numerous similar
					ads—its absurdity piqued my curiosity. I downloaded the game, only to be
					greeted by chores of redecorating a mansion, a far cry from the thrilling
					escapade portrayed.
				</p>
				<p>
					This stark discrepancy showcased the deceptive allure of ‘non-core gameplay
					ads’. Despite widespread awareness of their deviation from actual gameplay,
					these ads effectively draw viewers with exaggerated narratives.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					What Constitutes ‘Non-Core Gameplay Ads’?
				</h3>

				<p>
					The <i>Homescapes</i> advertisement exemplifies a distinct subgenre in
					mobile game advertising characterised by its use of animated sequences that
					simulate gameplay experiences. Notably, these depictions often
					significantly deviate from the actual game mechanics. Although this
					advertising approach raises ethical questions, it does not always
					constitute false advertising. The gameplay elements shown in these ads
					exist within the games, yet they are not the principal aspect of the gaming
					experience (Semenov, 2023). This type of promotional content has been
					accurately described as ‘non-core gameplay (NCG) ads’ by Nexters (2023). In
					this analysis, ‘NCG ads’ are defined as commercials that:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Promote a mobile game;
						</li>
						<li>
							Utilise primarily animation-based footage to simulate gameplay mechanics;
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not feature live actors or celebrities for voiceovers or promotional
							roles.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					Although created by various game developers, NCG advertisements share a
					distinct aesthetic that cements their place as a unique subgenre in digital
					game advertising. An animated finger is a recurring feature in these ads,
					implying player engagement with the game (as seen in Figs. 1, 2b & 3b). The
					gameplay showcased typically comprises straightforward, self-contained
					mini-puzzles designed to be intuitively understood by viewers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The narrative structure of NCG ads is also remarkably uniform and
					predictable. A representative case is the <i>Project Makeover</i>
					commercial (Fig. 2) (Magic Tavern, 2020; Project Makeover ads collection,
					2022). It begins with a mud-soaked girl discovering her partner’s
					unfaithfulness (Fig. 2a). Interactive elements emerge (Fig. 2b), with an
					animated finger making choices that lead to fleeting success or ultimate
					failure (Fig. 2c).
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast, the <i>Hero Wars</i> promotional video (Fig. 3) (Nexters,
					2016; The Hero Wars Ads Collector, 2021) echoes this structure: a central
					character faces challenges, and despite the player’s attempts at
					puzzle-solving, the outcome is typically unsuccessful. This pattern is
					consistent across various NCG ads, including the previously mentioned
					<i>Homescapes</i> ad. A notable evolution in NCG ads has been the increase
					in the absurdity of their plotlines, yet this foundational narrative
					structure has remained unchanged since its debut.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					The Power of Emotion: What Drives the Popularity of Non-Core Gameplay Ads?
				</h3>

				<p>
					NCG advertisements predominantly promote ‘casual mobile games’,
					characterised by their simple rules and low time commitments. In this game
					genre, game companies’ revenue models centre on in-game purchases and the
					integration of additional advertisements, turning players into commodities
					(Nieborg, 2017).
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequently, the core objective of these commercials is to captivate
					viewers and stimulate game downloads, a goal at which they have been
					notably successful. Mago (2020) traces the emergence of this genre to the
					summer of 2019, noting <i>Homescapes</i> and <i>Hero Wars</i> as earliest
					perpetrators (Playrix, 2017; Nexters, 2016). The immediate success has led
					many marketing teams to adopt similar advertising tactics. Over the last
					four years, this approach has become a standard in NCG advertising.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary audience for these advertisements encompasses a broad internet
					community, but ‘casual gamers’ form the central focus (Knezovic, 2023).
					This group ‘play to pass the time and simply want to be entertained and
					have some fun during a break’ and is particularly drawn to the accessible
					nature of mobile gaming, which starkly contrasts the more demanding
					financial and time commitments associated with traditional console gaming.
				</p>
				<p>
					While rarely mirroring the actual gameplay, the puzzles portrayed in NCG
					advertisements successfully communicate a sense of effortless, enjoyable
					escapism (Knezovic, 2023). Ihsan and Junaidi (2022) points out that the
					ease and low stakes of accessing free mobile games make emotional appeals
					in ads more compelling than logical arguments (see Fig. 4). As a result,
					these commercials often employ dramatic narratives and emotionally charged
					scenarios to prompt impulsive downloads. They evoke empathy or guilt by
					depicting protagonists in distress and a sense of challenge through the
					apparent failure to solve simple puzzles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, some NCG ads, such as those for <i>Project Makeover</i>, have
					introduced increasingly sexually suggestive storylines to stir strong
					emotional responses. In this context, how accurately these ads reflect the
					actual gameplay becomes secondary. The more memorable or contentious an
					advertisement is, the more likely it will lead to game downloads. Moreover,
					by going beyond the core gameplay mechanics, NCG ads can incorporate other
					appealing game aspects, like narrative and resource management elements.
					This approach broadens their appeal, attracting players who might not
					initially be interested in the gameplay mechanics.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					Public Perception of the Non-Core Gameplay Advertising Genre
				</h3>
				<p>
					The NCG advertising approach, perfected by <i>Hero Wars</i> and similar
					games, has markedly influenced player engagement in the casual mobile
					gaming genre. A survey by Nexters (2023), the company behind the game,
					underscores this impact. A considerable 71% of American respondents have
					reported encountering NCG promotions, and many voiced dissatisfaction after
					downloading the games.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prompted by the increasing discontent, a petition was initiated in August
					2019, shortly after the emergence of these advertisements, gaining thirteen
					thousand signatures (Hughes, 2019). Mirroring the escalating concerns
					regarding the truthfulness of such advertisements, the UK’s Advertising
					Standards Authority took action in 2020, labelling two commercials for
					<i>Homescapes</i> and <i>Gardenscapes</i> as ‘not representative’ (BBC,
					2020; Playrix, 2017, 2016).
				</p>
				<p>
					However, despite most players finding the actual gameplay less enthralling
					than depicted in the advertisements, half of those who downloaded the games
					based on these ads remained engaged with them, according to Nexters (2023).
					This contradictory response suggests that, while the initial
					misrepresentation might stain game ratings, they also establish a user base
					that eventually develops a liking for these games (Mago, 2020). There is a
					rising tolerance among players for such advertising tactics.
				</p>
				<p>
					The widespread adoption of NCG advertising strategies has led to
					homogenisation within the casual mobile gaming market, with little effort
					invested in innovation. Many companies replicate successful formulas, such
					as the ‘match-3’ mechanics popularised by <i>Candy Crush Saga</i> (King, 2012),
					which are prominent in games like <i>Homescapes</i> and <i>Royal Match</i> (Games, 2020).
					Consequently, these games resort to increasingly bold and sensational
					advertising methods to differentiate themselves in the highly competitive
					market.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					The Cost of Indulgence in Non-Core Gameplay Advertising
				</h3>
				<p>
					The emergence and widespread adoption of NCG advertisements mark a transition in the gaming industry’s commercial practices, reflecting a transformation in how we, predominantly as casual gamers, interact with gaming content. The low-commitment nature of downloading free mobile games paves the way for decisions driven more by emotional influence than logical evaluation. With their increasingly fantastical and provocative narratives, NCG advertisements are meticulously crafted to stimulate strong reactions, capitalising on the audience’s emotional susceptibility. In this environment, where emotional resonance outweighs logical assessment, the accuracy of advertisements in depicting actual gameplay becomes irrelevant. This situation has given rise to an implicit yet toxic understanding between marketing teams and their audience: we acknowledge the deceptive nature of these ads yet continue to download the games they promote.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, this indulgence comes at a cost. We are normalising ethically questionable practices and contributing to the erosion of integrity and creativity in games and their advertising. This trend pushes the industry towards a future where emotional persuasion overshadows authenticity and innovative content.
