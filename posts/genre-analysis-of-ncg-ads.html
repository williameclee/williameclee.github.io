					After an exhaustive day at school, I turned to YouTube for relaxation
					while
					my dinner rotated in the microwave.
					My calm was, however, soon shattered by a loud mobile game advertisement.
					A scene unfolded with a man in distress frantically fleeing from flames.
					An animated finger manipulated colossal sewing pins to remove obstacles
					along his escape.
					In a critical moment, the finger’s aid failed, leading to the man’s demise
					in the flames.

				</div>
				<p>
					The drama concluded by displaying the game’s title, <i>Homescapes</i>,
					alongside an ‘Install Now’ button <a href="#bib:Playrix2017"
						id="cite:Playrix2017-2"
						class="ref-mark">[1]</a>.
					While intuitively suspicious about the commercial’s authenticity—a result
					of encounters with numerous similar ads—its absurdity piqued my curiosity.
					I downloaded the game, only to be greeted by chores of redecorating a
					mansion, a far cry from the thrilling escapade portrayed.
				</p>
				<p>
					This stark discrepancy showcased the deceptive allure of ‘non-core
					gameplay ads’.
					Despite widespread awareness of their deviation from actual gameplay,
					these ads effectively draw viewers with exaggerated narratives.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					What Constitutes ‘Non-Core Gameplay Ads’?
				</h3>

				<p>
					The <i>Homescapes</i> advertisement exemplifies a distinct subgenre in
					mobile game advertising characterised by its use of animated sequences
					that simulate gameplay experiences.
					Notably, these depictions often significantly deviate from the actual game
					mechanics.
					Although this advertising approach raises ethical questions, it does not
					always constitute false advertising.
					The gameplay elements shown in these ads exist within the games, yet they
					are not the principal aspect of the gaming experience <a
						href="#bib:Semenov2023"
						id="cite:Semenov2023-1"
						class="ref-mark">[3]</a>.
					This type of promotional content has been accurately described as
					‘non-core gameplay (NCG) ads’ by Nexters <a href="#bib:Nexters2023"
						id="cite:Nexters2023-1"
						class="ref-mark">[4]</a>.
					In this analysis, ‘NCG ads’ are defined as commercials that:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Promote a mobile game;
						</li>
						<li>
							Utilise primarily animation-based footage to simulate gameplay
							mechanics;
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not feature live actors or celebrities for voiceovers or promotional
							roles.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					Although created by various game developers, NCG advertisements share a
					distinct aesthetic that cements their place as a unique subgenre in
					digital
					game advertising.
					An animated finger is a recurring feature in these ads, implying player
					engagement with the game (as seen in Figs. 1, 2b & 3b).
					The gameplay showcased typically comprises straightforward, self-contained
					mini-puzzles designed to be intuitively understood by viewers.

				<p>
					In contrast, the <i>Hero Wars</i> promotional video
					<a href="#bib:Nexters2016"
						id="cite:Nexters2016-2" class="ref-mark">[7,</a>
					<a href="#bib:HWAC2021"
						id="cite:HWAC2021-2" class="ref-mark">8]</a> echoes this structure: a
					central
					character faces challenges, and despite the player’s attempts at
					puzzle-solving, the outcome is typically unsuccessful.
					This pattern is consistent across various NCG ads, including the
					previously
					mentioned <i>Homescapes</i> ad.
					A notable evolution in NCG ads has been the increase in the absurdity of
					their plotlines, yet this foundational narrative structure has remained
					unchanged since its debut.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					The Power of Emotion: What Drives the Popularity of Non-Core Gameplay Ads?
				</h3>

				<p>
					NCG advertisements predominantly promote ‘casual mobile games’,
					characterised by their simple rules and low time commitments.
					In this game genre, game companies’ revenue models centre on in-game
					purchases and the
					integration of additional advertisements, turning players into commodities
					<a href="#bib:Nieborg2017"
						id="cite:Nieborg2017-1" class="ref-mark">[9]</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequently, the core objective of these commercials is to captivate
					viewers and stimulate game downloads, a goal at which they have been
					notably
					successful.
					Mago <a href="#bib:Mago2020"
						id="cite:Mago2020-1" class="ref-mark">[10]</a> traces the emergence of
					this genre to the summer of 2019,
					noting
					<i>Homescapes</i> and <i>Hero Wars</i> as earliest perpetrators <a
						href="#bib:Playrix2017"
						id="cite:Playrix2017-3"
						class="ref-mark">[1,</a>
					<a href="#bib:Nexters2016"
						id="cite:Nexters2016-3"
						class="ref-mark">7]</a>.
					The immediate success has led many marketing teams to adopt similar
					advertising tactics.
					Over the last four years, this approach has become a standard in NCG
					advertising.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary audience for these advertisements encompasses a broad internet
					community, but ‘casual gamers’ form the central focus
					<a href="#bib:Knezovic2023"
						id="cite:Knezovic2023-1" class="ref-mark">[11]</a>.
					This group ‘play to pass the time and simply want to be entertained and
					have
					some fun during a break’ and is particularly drawn to the accessible
					nature
					of mobile gaming, which starkly contrasts the more demanding financial and
					time commitments associated with traditional console gaming.
				</p>
				<p>
					While rarely mirroring the actual gameplay, the puzzles portrayed in NCG
					advertisements successfully communicate a sense of effortless, enjoyable
					escapism <a href="#bib:Knezovic2023"
						id="cite:Knezovic2023-2" class="ref-mark">[11]</a>.
					Ihsan and Junaidi
					<a href="#bib:Ihsan2022"
						id="cite:Ihsan2022-1" class="ref-mark">[12]</a>
					points out that the ease and low stakes of
					accessing free mobile games make emotional appeals in ads more compelling
					than logical arguments.
					As a result, these commercials often employ dramatic narratives and
					emotionally charged scenarios to prompt impulsive downloads. They evoke
					empathy or guilt by depicting protagonists in distress and a sense of
					challenge through the apparent failure to solve simple puzzles.

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Additionally, some NCG ads, such as those for <i>Project Makeover</i>,
					have
					introduced increasingly sexually suggestive storylines to stir strong
					emotional responses.
					In this context, how accurately these ads reflect the actual gameplay
					becomes secondary.
					The more memorable or contentious an advertisement is, the more likely it
					will lead to game downloads.
					Moreover, by going beyond the core gameplay mechanics, NCG ads can
					incorporate other appealing game aspects, like narrative and resource
					management elements.
					This approach broadens their appeal, attracting players who might not
					initially be interested in the gameplay mechanics.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					Public Perception of the Non-Core Gameplay Advertising Genre
				</h3>
				<p>
					The NCG advertising approach, perfected by <i>Hero Wars</i> and similar
					games, has markedly influenced player engagement in the casual mobile
					gaming
					genre.
					A survey by Nexters <a href="#bib:Nexters2023"
						id="cite:Nexters2023-2"
						class="ref-mark">[4]</a>, the company behind the game, underscores this
					impact. A considerable 71% of American respondents have reported
					encountering NCG promotions, and many voiced dissatisfaction after
					downloading the games.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prompted by the increasing discontent, a petition was initiated in August
					2019, shortly after the emergence of these advertisements, gaining
					thirteen
					thousand signatures <a href="#bib:Hughes2019"
						id="cite:Hughes2019-1"
						class="ref-mark">[13]</a>.
					Mirroring the escalating concerns regarding the truthfulness of such
					advertisements, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority took action in
					2020, labelling two commercials for <i>Homescapes</i> and
					<i>Gardenscapes</i> as ‘not representative’
					<a href="#bib:Playrix2017"
						id="cite:Playrix2017-4"
						class="ref-mark">[1,</a>
					<a href="#bib:BBC2020"
						id="cite:BBC2020-1"
						class="ref-mark">14,</a>
					<a href="#bib:Playrix2016"
						id="cite:Playrix2016-1"
						class="ref-mark">15]</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, despite most players finding the actual gameplay less enthralling
					than depicted in the advertisements, half of those who downloaded the
					games
					based on these ads remained engaged with them, according to Nexters
					<a href="#bib:Nexters2023"
						id="cite:Nexters2023-3"
						class="ref-mark">[4]</a>.
					This contradictory response suggests that, while the initial
					misrepresentation might stain game ratings, they also establish a user
					base
					that eventually develops a liking for these games
					<a href="#bib:Mago2020"
						id="cite:Mago2020-2"
						class="ref-mark">[10]</a>.
					There is a rising tolerance among players for such advertising tactics.
				</p>
				<p>
					The widespread adoption of NCG advertising strategies has led to
					homogenisation within the casual mobile gaming market, with little effort
					invested in innovation.
					Many companies replicate successful formulas, such as the ‘match-3’
					mechanics popularised by <i>Candy Crush Saga</i> <a href="#bib:King2012"
						id="cite:King2012-1"
						class="ref-mark">[16]</a>, which are
					prominent in games like <i>Homescapes</i> and <i>Royal Match</i>
					<a href="#bib:Games2020"
						id="cite:Games2020-1"
						class="ref-mark">[17]</a>.
					Consequently, these games resort to increasingly bold and sensational
					advertising methods to differentiate themselves in the highly competitive
					market.
				</p>

				<h3 class="section">
					The Cost of Indulgence in Non-Core Gameplay Advertising
				</h3>
				<p>
					The emergence and widespread adoption of NCG advertisements mark a
					transition in the gaming industry’s commercial practices, reflecting a
					transformation in how we, predominantly as casual gamers, interact with
					gaming content.
					The low-commitment nature of downloading free mobile games paves the way
					for
					decisions driven more by emotional influence than logical evaluation.
					With their increasingly fantastical and provocative narratives, NCG
					advertisements are meticulously crafted to stimulate strong reactions,
					capitalising on the audience’s emotional susceptibility.
					In this environment, where emotional resonance outweighs logical
					assessment,
					the accuracy of advertisements in depicting actual gameplay becomes
					irrelevant. This situation has given rise to an implicit yet toxic
					understanding between marketing teams and their audience: we acknowledge
					the
					deceptive nature of these ads yet continue to download the games they
					promote.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, this indulgence comes at a cost.
					We are normalising ethically questionable practices and contributing to
					the
					erosion of integrity and creativity in games and their advertising.
					This trend pushes the industry towards a future where emotional persuasion
					overshadows authenticity and innovative content.
